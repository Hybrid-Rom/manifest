Hybrid-RomÂ©
============

Hybrid-ROM is a combination of AOSP & CAF base.It all started thanks to the efforts of 
Android Open Development. Hybrid was made with simplicity and power in mind.
My goal is a Operating System complete with everything I want & need,
minus the bloat. There are features and code not implemented in Hybrid likely due to myself
not seeing the need, but pull request are always welcome and will be considered.


Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AndroidOpenDevelopment trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Hybrid-Rom/manifest.git -b 5.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j#  (#= number or cores supported by your build machine)
