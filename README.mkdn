Hybrid-RomÂ© 

Hybrid-ROM is a combination of CAF & AOSP base, while leaning
further towards CodeAurora. It all started thanks to the
efforts of Android Open Development. Hybrid was made with
simplicity and power in mind. My goal is an Operating System 
complete with everything I want & need, minus the bloat. There are 
features and code not implemented in Hybrid likely due to myself not 
seeing the need, but pull request are always welcome and will always be
strongly considered.

Getting Started 

To get started, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.
To initialize your local repository using 
hybrid source trees, use a command like this: 

repo init -u git://github.com/Hybrid-Rom/manifest.git -b 5.1 

Then to sync up:

repo sync -j#  (#= number or cores supported by your build machine)
